## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Keitumetse Precious Lefaso, IT Technician 

 ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on AWS cloud computing.i have just started my journey in AWS cloud computing, part of the AWS restart program and preparing to write AWS CLOUD PRACTITIONER EXAM!! 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about AWS cloud, exciting right? Join me in my journey and come along and do labs with me, using AWS management console, explore ec2 instances, VPC, Amazon RDS, Amazon Aurora and many other AWS services.
  
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on exploring AWS compute services, Database services, networking and content delivery services and ofcourse security services, we don't want our customers to feel not safe in the cloud.
  
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for collaborations with labs, this is where i as an aws cloud trainee act as an experience professional(support engineer, DevOpsengineer etc)  in the real world i am asked to solve real life problems, provided with access to aws management console and sometimes use ssh client; putty or session manager that is provided inside aws management console to solve those problems.
